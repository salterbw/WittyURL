Project

Meant to showcase all of the projects I am currently working on.  Contains information about start date, end date and by extension, if it's been completed.
It also shows a brief description of the project.  Finally, each project has a set of milestones which server as indication of progress on that particular project.
Each of these has a description of what I accomplished as well as the date and time I accomplished it (or at least when I entered it into the system).


Blog

An app which houses blog data.  Each entry would include a title, a date of writing and the entry itself.  Eventually commenting would be possible.  It is likely
there will be an easy way to share the entry with social networks.
